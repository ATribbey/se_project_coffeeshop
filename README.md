# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.
It is a description of a fictional coffee shop, including a scheduling tool, a menu, and some links to coffee recipes.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

In the future, I plan on adding a few more animations to the other parts of the page, rather than just the about section.
